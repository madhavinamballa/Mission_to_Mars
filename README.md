# Mission_to_Mars
In this assignment, we will build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page

## Step 1 - Scraping
* Create a Jupyter Notebook file called `mission_to_mars.ipynb` and use this to complete all of your scraping and analysis tasks. The following outlines what you need to scrape.
### NASA Mars News
* Scrape the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later
### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image
* url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars
### Mars Weather
* url=https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en
### Mars Facts
* url=https://space-facts.com/mars/
### Mars Hemispheres
* url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars
## Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application
Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.
